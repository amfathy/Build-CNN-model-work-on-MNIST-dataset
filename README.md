# MNIST CNN Example

This repository contains an example of building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Instructions

1. **Load and Preprocess the Data:**
   - The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed to prepare it for training.

2. **Build a CNN Model:**
   - A CNN model is constructed using TensorFlow/Keras. 

3. **Compile and Train the Model:**
   - The model is compiled with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric. Then, it's trained using the training data.

4. **Evaluate Model Performance:**
   - The trained model's performance is evaluated using both the training and testing sets.

5. **Visualize Filters of the First Convolutional Layer:**
   - Filters of the first convolutional layer are visualized to understand the features it learns.

6. **Display Feature Maps:**
   - Feature maps for a specific image in the test set are displayed to visualize the activations of different filters.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Python script containing the code for loading data, building, compiling, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
